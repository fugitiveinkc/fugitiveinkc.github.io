<p>In my last post, I addressed what my incentive was for deferring my medical education.  From there, I proceeded to list some of my weaknesses and strengths in order to lay the groundwork for my explorations within&#8217; the year.  Now that the groundwork has been laid, what have I done with the last four months to explore my inquiries and grow as a human being?  &#8230;Well&#8230; Hopefully <i>something</i>!</p>

<p>Naturally, my first schematic for self-studying and exploration was very scheduled and quite similar to what you might experience in college or any other institutionalized setting.  I first identified areas of study that would address my weaknesses and peak my interest.  Then, I proceeded to write a schedule where I treated Monday-Friday as a 40 hour work week for my explorations -oh the wonders of savings and not needing to be employed.  Below is an example of what my schedule resembled:</p>

<p><b>EVERYDAY:</b></p>
<p>Music: Jazz theory, Trumpet, Guitar [1.5 hours a day | One instrument a day]</p>
<p>Physical/Mental: Parkour, Method of Loci [1.5 hours a day | Pick one]</p>

<p><b>ONE OF TWO BELOW EVERY WEEKDAY:</b></p>
<p>Fine arts: Drawing, Anatomy [2 hours every other day | Switch between Anatomy & Drawing]</p>
<p>Awareness: History, Political Ideology Research [2 hours on the days with no fine arts]</p>

<p><b>ONE OF TWO BELOW EVERY WEEKDAY:</b></p>
<p>Programming/Mathematics: Raspberry Pi, Networking, Python, R [2.5 hours a day]</p>
<p>Social Intelligence/Engineering: Research on body language and behavioral science [2.5 hours a day]</p>

<p><b>MONTHLY:</b></p>
<p>Self-awareness: Blogging [1 post per month]</p>

<p>So now, four months later, how has this curriculum gone?  Just as I should have suspected institutionalized education would go.  My schedule has been great for learning a vast amount of material in a short amount of time, but in terms of fulfillment and self-satisfaction, it has been quite lacking.  How can that be if I spend most of my days studying what I want?</p>

<p><b>The answer</b>: With such a set schedule and institutional feel, there still feels like a sense of requirement and ranking rather than pure enjoyment.  My incentives get skewed towards learning a lot for some image I have rather than the true fulfillment of exploration.</p>

<p>When I was at the University of Kansas, I learned the most when a subject engaged me and I had room to practice it rather than worrying about what grade I got or how it would benefit my future career goals.  You know our current educational model is tainted when the incentive to learn is based on capital and job prospects rather than curiosity and vocation.  With that said, how do I reformulate my curriculum to be more satisfying?  Why did I choose this model in the first place?</p>

<p>Well, the reason I chose the institutionalized model has a simple answer: <b>It&#8217;s the main paradigm of education that I know!</b>  I&#8217;ve been socialized since a child by the methodologies of the US school system and that makes it hard for me to escape.  Perhaps this is part of my growth?  I&#8217;m learning how to learn as an autonomous being free from the restrictions of our current education system&#8230; <i>At least for now</i>.</p>

<p>Now, for the more important question.  I believe the way for me to make a more satisfying curriculum for myself is to base my education on goals and what I accomplish rather than what I should be doing.  My autodidactic incentives are based in curiosity rather than societal expectations, and as such, I should be praising my self on what I accomplish rather than bogging down on what I have to do.  So based on my weaknesses/strength and subjects of interest, what are my goals?</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to feel physically empowered as well as know how my mind works.</li>
<li>Musically, I want to be able to play bebop jazz and apply it to many different genres.  Specifically, I want to be more proficient than I am now on guitar and trumpet.</li>
<li>For medical school and for my own personal aesthetic desires, I want to learn to draw so I can sketch what I see quickly.</li>
<li>I want to be more articulate on points in politics and social justice issues.  I want to learn more about Anarchism and history, both US and World History.</li>  
<li>I want to indulge in technological pursuits by learning about Linux, the Raspberry Pi, Python and computer networking.</li>
<li>There will always be a place in my heart for mathematics, and as such I would like to gain a stronger grasp on statistics and analysis.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a lot of value as a future physician in being able to understand humans on both a intellectual and emotional level.  I hope to learn more about human body language and behavior in order to better understand my friends, family, romantic partners, acquaintances and future patients.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that my goals have been listed, how can I approach these goals without having a rigorous schedule?  I first need to identify which goals require regular practice.  Subjects like music and physical fitness require regular practice in order to progress.  I just need to remember that progressing here shouldn&#8217;t feel obligatory but rather motivated by curiosity.  If at anytime it feels driven by a sense of necessity, then I need to re-evaluate why I&#8217;m practicing regularly. With every other subject listed, as long as I engage in one of those activities daily and make more specific, concrete goals, there&#8217;s no reason I need a detailed schedule to fulfill myself.  I have a basic schedule now that is not hard set.  It&#8217;s more based on immediate interest rather than a sense of obligation.</p>

<p>As I continue through my new curriculum, I need be open towards changing at anytime.  Perhaps the perfect system for an autodidact is based on constant adaptation?  I&#8217;m starting to think so.  I also need to make sure that every activity I engage in has a communal aspect/lab portion to it.  I need people to talk to, practice with and engage with if I&#8217;m looking to really learn and retain what I learn.</p>  

<p>And with that, let the journey continue!</p>
<br />
<p>On performing a perfect central line installation: “I still have no idea what I did differently that day.  But from then on, my lines went in.  Practice is funny that way.  For days and days, you make out only the fragments of what to do.  And then one day you&#8217;ve got the thing whole.  Conscious learning become unconscious knowledge, and you cannot say precisely how.” -Atul Gawande</p>
